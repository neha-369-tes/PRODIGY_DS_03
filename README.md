# Customer Purchase Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier

## Project Overview

This project involves building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Key Components

### üîç Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Values**: Cleaned the dataset by addressing any missing values.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Converted categorical variables into numerical formats to facilitate analysis.
- **Feature Scaling**: Scaled features to ensure a robust model.

### üå≥ Model Building
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Implemented a decision tree classifier to analyze how various factors influence customer purchasing behavior.

### üìà Model Evaluation
- **Performance Metrics**: Assessed the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Visualization**: Visualized the decision tree to understand key decision points in the model.
